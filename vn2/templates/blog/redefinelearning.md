# Redefining the Foundational Pillars of Education

Schools haven't changed in 100 years. Yet life today looks very different than it did 100 years ago. And what is the purpose of schools, if not to prepare students for life?

My interest is not in teaching the world as it was 100 years go, or as it is in books. I have no interest in subjects like reading, math, biology, chemistry, _unless_ they are directly and intimately tied to the real world. It is a great disservice that we let students dive deep into ancient textbooks that they promptly forget about once they leave school. How many times have you seen this happen: student learns everything there is to know about the mitochondria, and they never once use this knowledge after graduating, except for a very small fraction that may work in a field related to biology.

Also, isn't the mitochondria (and other cellular biology) readily available online for anyone who is curious?

Ah, but how do students know that they might be curious about it? The point of school, it could be argued, is to expose students to a plethora of options, so that they may gain interest and pursue it on their own.

In this I am in agreement. But not so fast! The way we teach mitochondria in schools is to give chapters upon chapters and lectures upon lectures, added to homework, and tests, to memorize many many facts about this very specific, tiny piece of biology. Instead of taking them to a buffet where they can try many foods, we've taken them to a buffet and filled their plate with a single vegetable, and told them they better eat it or no dessert.

This cannot stand. Humans are meant to be free to explore and learn on their own, not to be spoon fed!

Thus, I present to you the first pillar of my ideal school:


## Pillar I: Discovery & Exploration

As a fundamental approach to learning, students should be given a chance to explore and discover on their own, not to be spoon fed. I'm not suggesting we let children run amok all day, hoping they will find things that interest them -- surely they will immediately find MineCraft, FortNite and Reddit for memes, and that will amount to a serious amount of wasted time. 

How, then do we create a fertile environment for discovery and exploration? This brings me to the next pillar:


## Pillar II: Everything is Project Based

Rather than giving _total_ freedom, my suggestion is to give _partial_ freedom to pursue projects. Some projects may be discovered or created by the students; others will be suggested by the mentors and coaches of the school. Now, I'm avoiding the word Teacher for a specific reason, which I'll get  to in my next pillar.

Projects are beautiful. They are the perfect learning mechanism, because they mirror what reality is actually like. Every single exchange of value and part of living an adult life is project based, from building rocketships to houses, from doing your taxes to writing business proposals, from running academic studies to cooking dinner for your family. Everything is a project in life, and school should reflect life. When it comes to the logistics of how to create a fertile environment for learning with projects as the medium, well ... that's a whole other blog post.


## Pillar III: All Projects Are Student Led

This may be one of the most revolutionary and against-the-grain pillars of my ideal school. Indeed, who ever heard of a school without _teachers_? But we don't _need_ teachers. We have YouTube and Khan Academy and countless resources online to learn anything you could ever hope to learn. What a student needs is a topic to learn about, a driver to learn it, and perhaps, a coach and a mentor to help guide you in the learning process. 

All projects will be led by students. I won't go into more details here, but if you were to walk into this school on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, here's what you'd see:

• Instead of students sitting and facing a teacher giving a lecture,

You'd see small groups of students using computers to learn about something.

• Instead herds of student shuffling toward a new room every hour to the chime of a bell,

	You'd see mentors and coaches walking and checking with each group about progress.

• Instead of reading decades-old textbooks on traditional subjects,

	You'd see students finding modern materials online to support their current projects.


## Pillar IV: New Core Competencies

School traditionally focuses curriculum on math, science, English, history, art, and the like. Not in my ideal world! Here are the core competencies that students at my ideal school will be expected to build over their academic career:

**	**

**Wealth Building**

It is one of the most important aspects of life to manage money well so you do not fall into debt and perpetual labor. And in keeping with modeling actual reality, what's more real than having to pay rent?

**	**

**Emotional Intelligence**

You know what I was never taught in school? How to love myself, know myself, and care for myself. How to live life in a way that works for me. How to deal with adversity. Now that I'm an adult I'm amazed at what a positive difference being aware of EQ has made for my life. 

**Universal Problem Solving**

Sounds simple enough -- but there are many methodologies and it's critical to have this universal skill. Learners should learn to model problems mentally and build a mental toolbox to conquer any challenge.

**Power & Governance**

Understanding power structures, government, and how human tribes come together to form civilization will help prepare students to tackle the hardest problems or war, political corruption, surveillance, and corporate power. Most critically they can learn about this from the context of their own city and country, so they can understand current elections and campaigns.

**Religion & Spirituality**

Spirituality and religion are an integral part of our emotional growth as a civilization, and students should be free to learn about many approaches and pursue them if they so wish.

This article is the current draft of my vision for the school I would like to cofound. It is not complete or perfect; the pillars and core competencies may change as I learn more and collaborate with others. However, the basic idea is the same: School has a _lot_ of room for improvement, and it's critical that we take steps toward new school structures to break out of the old mould that isn't working.
